# Neighbourhood-Map.
To develop a single page application featuring a map of a neighborhood i would like to visit. Udacity Project

## Project Detail:
* It is an app that display Eight(8) locations of Hotels and Restaurant of a neighborhood.
  Then I added functionality to the map including highlighted locations, third-party data (Foursquare) 
  about the locations and various ways to browse the content.
* Registered the app on google map developer site so as to be able to initiate the map into my project through there API. A key was given.
* Register the app at Foursquare developer site to have access to there data through there API. 
  A client id and client secret was generated for this app.
* A json was then use to pull the data from foursquare into my app before using html to display them with some style.
* Side nav that display the listed location was done with the help of javascript with some styles.
* The lessons acquired during class session at [Full Stack Web Development Nanodegree](https://in.udacity.com/course/full-stack-web-developer-nanodegree--nd004/))
  really made it easy to execute this project, especially the Cat clicker lesson, the ajax (NewYorkTime and wikipedia) lesson
  and the map project lesson that was done in class at the end of the section.
